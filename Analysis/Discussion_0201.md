# Requirements

- Read the system specification carefully. Make a **draft design of the UI for the major functions**. **Hand-drawn diagram** is good enough for our discussion.
- If you’ve decided which programming language / platform to use, proceed to **system architecture design**. Think about what will be done on the client or server side, which database system to use, what web framework to use, etc. **Set up a development machine or cloud platform**. **Engage members in coding**.
- If time allows, perform data modelling. A <u>draft ER diagram</u> is good enough. Make sure your database design can support the functional requirements you’ve selected in your project work plan.
